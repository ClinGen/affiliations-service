# ClinGen Affiliation Service

This service provides a web interface for ClinGen admins to create, view, 
update, and destroy ClinGen affiliations. ClinGen affiliations are groups of 
biocurators who work together to curate genes and variants in the gene curation 
interface (GCI) and the variant curation interface (VCI), respectively. 
This service also provides a JSON API.
