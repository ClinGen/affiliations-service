# Logs

When running locally, logs are written to stdout. When running on AWS,
logs can be viewed in CloudWatch. To view the logs, navigate to the
CloudWatch web console, then in the side bar click the link to the log
groups page. Then look for the `web.stdout.log` log group. Then click
the appropriate log stream (probably the most recent one).
