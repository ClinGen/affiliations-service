# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-10-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We decided to use ADRs to make it easier for future maintainers to understand
the implementation decisions we have chosen and our reasoning behind them.

## Decision

We add ADRs to the /doc/adr subdirectory following the `adr-tools` and
`adr-tools-python` documentation advice in
[Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

## Consequences

Hopefully future maintainers are able to understand why the project was built in
the way that it is.
