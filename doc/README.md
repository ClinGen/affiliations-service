# Documentation

This is the documentation for the affiliations service. We follow the
[Divio documentation organization system](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction.html).

- [Tutorials](./tutorial.md) (learning-oriented)
  - Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of
    steps to complete a project of some kind. Unlike how-to guides, tutorials
    don't assume lots of prerequisite knowledge.
  - [Get started](./tutorial.md#get-started)
- [How-to guides](./howto.md) (problem-oriented)
  - How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a
    real-world problem. They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end.
    Unlike tutorials, they typically assume a fair amount of prerequisite
    knowledge.
  - [Run code checks](./howto.md#run-code-checks)
  - [Organize imports and constants](./howto.md#organize-imports-and-constants)
  - [Write a TODO comment](./howto.md#write-a-todo-comment)
  - [Write a commit message](./howto.md#write-a-commit-message)
  - [Name a Git branch](./howto.md#name-a-git-branch)
- [Explanations](./explanation.md) (understanding-oriented)
  - Explanation, or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic. They
    broaden the documentationâ€™s coverage of a topic. Explanations can equally
    well be described as discussions; they are discursive in nature. They are a
    chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software,
    taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even from
    different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being read
    at leisure, rather than over the code.
