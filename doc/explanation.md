# Explanations

Explanations discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and
provide useful background information. They are understanding-oriented.

## Understanding the Old and New Affiliations Workflow

When we first started working on the affiliations service, we created
diagrams for the old (then current) affiliations workflow and the 
new (then desired) affiliations workflow. These diagrams didn't win any
design awards, and they are a bit outdated (and therefore inaccurate), 
but they get the high-level point across.

## Using the Admin Site for the Affiliations Service

The affiliations service is meant to be an internal tool for a small 
group of ClinGen employees. When we first started developing it, we 
didn't care much about making it a "proper" / "production grade" web 
service. It just needed to be better than the old system of 
sending emails and updating spreadsheets.
