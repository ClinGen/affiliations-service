# Explanations

Description from
[Divio documentation](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/explanation/):

Explanations, or discussions, should clarify and illuminate a particular topic.
They should broaden the documentationâ€™s coverage of a topic. This page is
understanding-oriented.

## Affiliations Workflow Diagrams

We have diagrams for our current and desired affiliations workflow in the
[diagrams directory](./diagrams).

## Styling

We use
[django-unfold](https://github.com/unfoldadmin/django-unfold?tab=readme-ov-file)
to style the Django admin panel.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

We utilize ADRs documentation to make it easier for future contributors to
understand our reasons for implementation choices and rationale.

For more information on ADRs, please visit some of the below resources:

- https://www.redhat.com/architect/architecture-decision-records
- https://adr.github.io/

We are utilizing [adr-tools-python](https://pypi.org/project/adr-tools-python/),
additional information can be found in their documentation.

- Can create a new ADR by using `adr-new {name of adr}`.
- Can utilize `adr-list` to see a list of all ADRs in the terminal.
