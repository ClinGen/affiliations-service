# Explanations

Description from
[Divio documentation](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/explanation/):

Explanations, or discussions, should clarify and illuminate a particular topic.
They should broaden the documentationâ€™s coverage of a topic. This page is
understanding-oriented.

## Affiliations Workflow Diagrams

We have diagrams for our current and desired affiliations workflow in the
[diagrams directory](./diagrams).

## Styling

We use
[django-unfold](https://github.com/unfoldadmin/django-unfold?tab=readme-ov-file)
