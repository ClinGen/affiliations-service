## References

Description from 
[Divio documentation](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/reference/):

Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how 
to operate it.

Reference guides have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined, 
because ultimately that's what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, 
and so they should list things like functions, attributes and methods, 
and set out how to use them.

This page is information-oriented.
